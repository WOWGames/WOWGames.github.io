And so we begin!

We weren't sure what to expect, but we're sure that a lot of us only thought of this class as a course that we needed to pass to check it off of our course list.

Right off the bat on the first day, we were already making groups and planning our game. However, it wasn't just a game we had to make. We also needed to market our game, hype it up, and everything in between.

Basically, we are going to learn what it takes to be a gaming company in ten weeks.

We had some good ideas passed around, and we eventually settled on making an awesome RPG (role-playing game). One thing that would make the game different from other RPGs are making it a parody of an RPG along with the concept of "followers" in the game, where the main character gains other characters who will fight for him.

As for the rest, I guess we'll just see what happens in the remaining nine weeks! This is the beginning of our first game!
