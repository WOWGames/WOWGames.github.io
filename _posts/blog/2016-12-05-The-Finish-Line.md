Guys, guys! It's been a while since we went silent as we submerged ourselves into our game project, but we are now emerging with something of a masterpiece!

In only ten weeks, we are proud to present our game, MILK! To be honest, we did more than we had planned and it turned out to be one of the coolest projects yet.

Check it out [here]({{ site.basurl }}/games/milk/)!

Everything you need to know about this awesome game is in this documentation [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/doc/designdoc.pdf).

It's been quite the quarter, and needless to say, it's been quite the adventure. We finished right on time, and the only thing left is our presentation on Tuesday, December 6th from 1-3pm at UC Irvine. Come check us out at our booth!
