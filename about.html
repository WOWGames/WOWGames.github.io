            <h3>More About WOW Games</h3>
            <p>Hello! We are students at the University of California, Irvine. Our goal for this quarter in our Computer Development Game class is to create and develop an awesome, non-"match-three" game. However, we don't just make any game, we are also doing much more, like marketing and building hype and maintaining documentation -- almost as though we were a real game company.
            <p>We decided to go with a parody of a classic RPG (role-playing game). Although we have only ten total weeks to put everything together, we've been at this nonstop!
            <p>Don't forget to see our game, Milk! Check it out on the Games page!
